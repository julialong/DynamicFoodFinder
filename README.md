Are you busy? If you're like most adults that study and work in the 21st century, your answer is probably yes. As our lives develop faster and faster paces, filled to the brim with school, work, family, and friends, it becomes increasingly important for us to find time to enjoy the small things in life, including mealtime!

We recognize that many people manage parts of their busy schedule by eating on-the-go but are often limited by the choices that show up as nearby their current location. These choices may be less than ideal but most people are unable to spend large amounts of time checking through food options along their commute.

So we're introducing Dynamic, a web application that helps people choose the best restaurant option for them between where they are and where they need to be. Your dinner options are no longer restricted by fast food venues that pay to advertise by the interstate or by unhelpful suggestions from your phone that give you restaurants that are in the opposite way from where you're going. You can now take charge of your mealtime â€” merely input your current location and your destination, and get a list of restaurant locations tailored to your route. We built this application using the Google Maps and Google Places APIs to help us determine the optimal route between your start and endpoints and search for the most relevant restaurants along this path, respectively. Once the user inputs their locations, they are greeted by an interactive map with pins in the spot of each suggested restaurant, along with a comprehensive list of venues along their route.

Once the user selects their preference, they are given directions to that location. In the future, we will expand Dynamic to allow users to customize price ranges they are looking for, types of fare, and even different kinds of stores! You will soon be able to plan out the optimal gas station, supermarket, or even toy store along your daily route!
